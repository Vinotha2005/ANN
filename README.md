## 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

This project predicts whether a bank customer will exit (churn) or stay using a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model built with TensorFlow/Keras.
The application is deployed with Streamlit for easy user interaction.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn refers to customers leaving a service or company.
Predicting churn helps banks retain customers and improve business strategies.

This project includes:

A trained ANN model (churn_model.h5)

Data preprocessing pipeline (preprocessor.pkl)

Interactive Streamlit web app (app.py) for live predictions

## 🧮 Model Details

Input Features:
CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance,
NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary

Target Variable:
Exited

0 → Customer stays

1 → Customer churns (leaves the bank)

ANN Architecture:

Input Layer: 10 neurons

Hidden Layers: 2 Dense layers with ReLU activation

Output Layer: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

Metric: Accuracy

## 📊 Example Output (from Streamlit App)
Input	Output
Credit Score: 619, Age: 42, France, Female	Churn Probability: 0.27 → Low Chance of Churn (Exited = 0)

🟢 Low Chance of Churn → Customer likely to stay
🔺 High Chance of Churn → Customer likely to leave

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Value (example)
Accuracy	86%
Precision	83%
Recall	78%
F1-Score	80%

## 🧠 Model Interpretation

The ANN learns complex patterns from customer attributes to estimate churn probability.

A Sigmoid output gives a probability between 0 and 1.

> 0.5 → Predicts churn (Exited = 1)

< 0.5 → Predicts retention (Exited = 0)
